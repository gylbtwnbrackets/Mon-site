            Born on the 29 August 1958, Michael Jackson is the 8th child among 9 other siblings.
            <br>Joe Jackson (His father) was the first one to ever introduce him and his brothers to the world of music,
            as a fellow musician.
            <br>Joe wanted to fulfill his long lost dream of being a renowned musician and chose to do so throught his sons
            <br>by forming "The Jackson Five"
            <br>Altough his methods were rough, he managed to arrange them mutliple public appearances, 
            <br>the first one on National Tv being on the "Hollywood Palace" in 1969.

            <br> The group will go on to become very successfull, mainly because of Michael Jackson's talent 
            <br> which set him appart from his other brothers. Their first hit song, <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiGY7zX7VqQ">"I Want You Back"</a> was released in 1979

            </div>
            <br> However, being famous as such a young age comes with its downside, namely the pressure put unto him by his father,
            <br> that prevented him to have a "normal" childhood. It explains how Michael went on to have childlike interest in his adulthood
            <br> to catch up to what he missed out on.
            <br> Being the main star of the Jackson 5, Michael already released his first solo album in 1972, at only 14 years old !
            <br> This already tells us how successful he will become in later years
