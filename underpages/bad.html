            <h2>Its origins</h2>
            <p> On this record, Michael Jackson opperates a change of image and takes on a more "rebel" persona.</p>
            <p>Released in 1987, it sparked a little contreversy because of the sudden change but the album was still hugely succesful both critically and comercially</p>
            <h2>Why do I like it</h2>
            <p> I didn't really listen much to this album because I don't really like much of the songs on there, they go in a less "funky" direction and more towards "Rock" which I don't prefer.
            Altough I have to admit that I really enjoy "Bad" because I think it keeps a bit of the funk we could find in ulterior MJ's albums
