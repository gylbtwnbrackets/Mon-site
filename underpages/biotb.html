        <h2>Its origins</h2>
        <p> Unlike the two other songs, this one came out in 1977, when Michael and his borther were a bit older<br></p>
        <p>Fun fact: Not many people know this but this song was originally written by a british singer named... <br> Michael Jackson (not the same)! </p>
        <p>Blame it on the boogie is a re-interpretation of the song for the American audience and ended up being more popular than the original</p>
        <h2>Why do I like it</h2>
        <p> I discovered this song along with other Jackson's 5 five songs of this era but this one sticked out to me because of the music video</p>
        <p>I don't know why but many music videos in the 70's to 80's seemed to have used this weird visual effect, but i really like it nonetheless !</p>
        <p>Other music use similar effect such as "Get down on it" by Kool & the Gang or "Let's Groove" by Earth,Wind and Fire </p>
