            <h2>Its origins</h2>
            <p> First Michael Jackson album of the 90's, this album really is a product of it's time, notably with the amount of money put into it : 10 millions $ ! </p>
            <p>The album was released in 1991 and , in typical Michael Jackson's fashion, it was accompanied by breathtaking music video such as "Remember the time" or "Black or White" 
            The music videos were really innovating on special effects but were also the reason of the enormous price of the album's production</p>
            <h2>Why do I like it</h2>
            <p>You may have noticed, but I insint on the music videos because those are really what made me love the album. I remember my father showing the music video telling me how revolutionnay it was at the time.
                Musicaly wise, my favourite would be "Remember the Time" because I like how it sounds like a typical RnB songs from the 90's but with MJ's touch.
