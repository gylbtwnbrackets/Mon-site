                <h2>Its origins</h2>
                <p> This is the first "real" solo album of Michael Jackson, he already had some before this one but he was still a child<br></p>
                <p></p>Still under the Motown label, the album came out in 1979 and was a Huge Success, even earning him a Grammy Award </p>
                <h2>Why do I like it</h2>
                <p> Altough some songs on this album are really famous such as "Don't stop 'till you get Enough" or "Rock with You", I still think that the Album is overlooked</p>
                <p>Personnaly my favourite songs are the title track "Off the wall" and "It's the falling in love" which I really because i really relate to them</p>
